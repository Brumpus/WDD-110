    <h2>Quinton Hogan</h2>
    <p>Hey all, My name is Quinton and I enjoy art! I try to do a lot of painting, but as I've been busy with work and school as of late, I've mostly just been doodling in my off time. I've got some time off soon, so I'm planning to visit a beach to try and paint it in an effort to finally relax. I'm currently studying for my bachelor's in applied technology and I'm very excited.</p>
    <p>I've always been a huge fan of technology and the internet, so I'm grateful to be taking this class so I can learn how to be a part of it. It's definitely an important part of our daily lives. I know I use the internet everyday for games, school, and even talking to my friends. </p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church since I was 8 years old, and my favorite story I've ever heard is the story of the currant bush told ny Hugh B. Brown. It's a very touching story, but I would recommend searching for it because I couldn't do it justice here. It always reminds me that even though I have a plan for myself, God might have a different plan for me, and that's okay.</p>
