        Hi! I'm Quinton, and this is my painting website! I've been painting since I was a kid, but I've only started taking it seriously in the past three years. I really enjoy it and I love to share it with the world.
        It all started when I just felt an overwhelming urge to paint a mural on my wall. It was a feeling that stuck with me for weeks, until eventually one day I had eaten a whole pizza, finished watching Wreck-it-Ralph 2, and it was midnight. Somehow, those three things led me to just go for it, and for the next three hours I was an artist. I fell asleep at 3 am, feeling very satisfied with my work, and the rest is history.
        I continued painting on my mission over facebook live in an effort to reach people and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with them. It's one of my favorite memories about my mission, and I was able to meet so many cool people because of it.
        Here on this website you can see information about and pictures of my most recent paintings, along with links to my social medias, and website's where I might stream my painting process. I'm currently really busy with work and school, but I'll update this site as I paint more.
        Hopefully I can share some of they joy I feel while painting during your visit here, and maybe you'll even feel like trying it out for yourself.

      <h3>Paintings</h3>
      <p>
        Here's some of my most recent paintings! 
        I don't have a name for this one yet. I painted it while visiting my grandparents on vacation. It was a very relaxing experience, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to try it. It's a painting of Payette Lake, in McCall. It's a beautiful place. I meant to paint a second painting in the nearby state park, but of course all good things must come to an end; and I ran out of vacation time and wasn't able to do it.
        This is my second most recent painting. It all started when I bought a pack of canvases at a craft store. One of them had a hole in it, but I figured I could do something with it, so I kept it instead of just buying a different one. The manager was very kind and gave me a discount, so it was worth it. I wanted it to hve some sort of 3D element, so I made the hole even bigger. 
        I've always been fascinated by space, and it's infinite vastness. It's something that scares and excites me. I also sometimes feel like I want to run away from all my problems, and going to space seems like it would be a very effective way to accomplish that.

      <h3>Where to Find me</h3>
      <p>
        Here are all the links to my social medias.
        You can find me on instagram where I try to post my paintings as soon as I finish them.  https://www.instagram.com/quintonspaintparty/
        Sometimes I'll stream my painting process on Twitch.tv, Facebook, or Youtube 
        https://www.twitch.tv/quintonspaintparty https://www.facebook.com/PaintingWithQuinton/  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXtxavUqtH_weN4GeSxATRQ
        Streaming is probably my favorite way to share my art. It gives people the opportunity to ask questions and see how the job gets done. This probably doesn't come as a surprise, but Bob Ross was my inspiration for all this. The way he made people feel welcome, and made sure we all knew that we all have what it takes to make beautiful artwork. I've sort of drifted away from that style, to try and find my own way of doing things, but it's always helpful to remember where you came from.
