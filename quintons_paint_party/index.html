                <p id="intro">Hi! I'm Quinton, and this is my painting website!</p>
                <p id="story">I've been painting since I was a kid, but I've only started taking it seriously in the past three years. I really enjoy it and I love to share it with the world. It all started when I just felt an overwhelming urge to paint a mural on my wall. It was a feeling that stuck with me for weeks, until eventually one day I had eaten a whole pizza, finished watching Wreck-it-Ralph 2, and it was midnight. Somehow, those three things led me to just go for it, and for the next three hours I was an artist. I fell asleep at 3 am, feeling very satisfied with my work, and the rest is history.</p>
                <p id="continuation">I continued painting on my mission over facebook live in an effort to reach people and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with them. It's one of my favorite memories about my mission, and I was able to meet so many cool people because of it. Here on this website you can see information about and pictures of my most recent paintings, along with links to my social medias, and website's where I might stream my painting process. I'm currently really busy with work and school, but I'll update this site as I paint more. Hopefully I can share some of they joy I feel while painting during your visit here, and maybe you'll even feel like trying it out for yourself.</p>
