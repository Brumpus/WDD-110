            <p id="intro">Here's some of my most recent paintings!</p>
            <p id="statement1"> I don't have a name for this one yet. I painted it while visiting my grandparents on vacation. It was a very relaxing experience, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to try it. It's a painting of Payette Lake, in McCall. It's a beautiful place. I meant to paint a second painting in the nearby state park, but of course all good things must come to an end; and I ran out of vacation time and wasn't able to do it. </p>
            <p id="statement2">This is my second most recent painting. It all started when I bought a pack of canvases at a craft store. One of them had a hole in it, but I figured I could do something with it, so I kept it instead of just buying a different one. The manager was very kind and gave me a discount, so it was worth it. I wanted it to hve some sort of 3D element, so I made the hole even bigger. I've always been fascinated by space, and it's infinite vastness. It's something that scares and excites me. I also sometimes feel like I want to run away from all my problems, and going to space seems like it would be a very effective way to accomplish that.
